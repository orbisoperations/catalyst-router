# Catalyst Node Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") v1.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Catalyst Node, a project
maintained by Orbis Operations LLC ("the Company"). In order to clarify the
intellectual property licenses granted with Contributions from any person or
entity, the Company must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file
that has been agreed to by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the
license terms below.

This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection
of the Company and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own
Contributions for any other purpose.

To agree to this CLA, please complete and sign the signature block at the
bottom of this document and submit it to the Company by opening a pull request
that adds your name and details to the CONTRIBUTORS file in the project
repository, or by sending a signed copy to the Company via the method specified
in the project's contributing guidelines.

Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your
records.

## Definitions

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by
the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the Company. For legal
entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered
to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control"
means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management
of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership
of such entity.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally Submitted
by You to the Company for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the
products or projects owned or managed by the Company (the "Work"). For the
purposes of this definition, "Submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal,
or written communication sent to the Company or its representatives, including
but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code
control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf
of, the Company for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

"Work" shall mean the Catalyst Node project and any other project owned or
managed by the Company to which Contributions may be made.

## 1. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the
Company and to recipients of software distributed by the Company a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative
works.

## 2. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the
Company and to recipients of software distributed by the Company a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only
to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work
to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent
litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to
which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this
Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

## 3. Representations

You represent that:

(a) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If Your employer(s)
has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your
Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make
Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such
rights for Your Contributions to the Company, or that Your employer has
executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Company.

(b) Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see Section 5 for
submissions on behalf of others).

(c) Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party
license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents
and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are associated with
any part of Your Contributions.

## 4. No Warranty

Your Contributions are provided on an "AS IS" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are not expected to
provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to
provide support.

## 5. Third-Party Submissions

Should You wish to Submit work that is not Your original creation, You may
Submit it to the Company separately from any Contribution, identifying the
complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction
(including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license
agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the
work as "Submitted on behalf of a third party: [named here]."

## 6. Notification

become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
